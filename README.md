# 🔥Mini-Project-Keylogger As a mini project
We developed keylogging software in Python3 that records every keystrokes of physical as
well as on-screen keyboard, and delivers keylogs through email in response to a timer.
Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description
We created a graphical user interface for simply receiving input and logging keystrokes in response to the timer. We utilised a variety of libraries such as tkinter, pynput.keyboard, logging, time, smtplib, ssl, email, threading, and so on.
## Getting Started
* In order to start a Python code, we must install a few packages; to do so, run pip install (package name)
* To create an app password for our application, visit https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en for more information.
* Auto-py-to-exe may be installed to create an executable file for a Python code.
